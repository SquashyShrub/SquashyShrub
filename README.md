# About Me
My passion for technology was sparked when I first ventured into game development, building a game from the ground up using Game Maker Studio. Although I earned just 17 cents from the published game, the experience of navigating challenges and bringing an idea to life was incredibly rewarding. It was in that process that my excitement for software development took root. Since then, I've become fascinated by the endless possibilities within technologyâ€”from cloud computing and video games to simple yet powerful console applications. I thrive on the problem-solving aspect of development, always eager to explore new tools, languages, and technologies that push the boundaries of what's possible. This drive to learn and create fuels my passion for innovation and keeps me excited about the future of software development.

I'm also in the process of designing and whiteboarding a financial web application via Blazor with plans to start developing in the coming weeks.
