# About Me
My passion for technology ignited when I dove into game development, creating a game from scratch using Game Maker Studio. Despite earning only 17 cents from publishing my game on itch.io, the process of overcoming challenges fueled my excitement for software development. I love all things software from the cloud, video games or simple console applications.
