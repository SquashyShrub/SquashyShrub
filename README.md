# About Me
My passion for technology ignited when I dove into game development, creating a game from scratch using Game Maker Studio. Despite earning only 17 cents from the published game, the process of overcoming challenges fueled my excitement for software development. I love all things software from the cloud, video games or simple console applications.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a 3D adventure game using the Godot engine featuring various quests, enemy AI, and a linear storyline to follow. I'm also designing and whiteboarding a financial web application via Blazor hoping to start developing in the coming weeks.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement SQL Databases in various applications, and the fundamentals of the Azure cloud.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: LinkedIn and email are the best ways to contact me, see my profile for the links!
